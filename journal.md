# Introduction

Haywood et al (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over tyhe sahara.
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000).

# Simulations


John has made simulations of particle formation using some model.
it reproduces something observed and blahhhhh blahhhhh.

# Conclusion

This conclusion is much better
It includes capitals.

#methodology

We used AMS (Allen et al 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical composition

# Results

We observed particle growth through coagulation, and report some results.

#Conclusuions

We made some ground breaking discovery.
Need more .....

# Figures

This is where the figures go in a draft manuscript.
